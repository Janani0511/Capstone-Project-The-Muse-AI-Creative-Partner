They know *what happened*, but they are stuck on *what happens next*. Standard LLM prompts often result in generic tropes or, worse, hallucinated historical and scientific facts that break immersion.\n\n**The Solution:** \"The Muse\" is not just a chatbot. It is an autonomous **Multi-Agent System** designed to be an intelligent creative partner. Instead of just guessing, it actively researches real-world context related to the user's story draft to generate surprising, fact-based plot twists.\n\n## 🏗️ System Architecture\n\nThis project moves beyond simple prompting by orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents, demonstrating the advanced concepts covered in the \"5 Days of AI\" course:\n\n1.  **🕵️‍♂️ The Researcher Agent (Grounding):** It doesn't just write; it uses **Tools** (native function calling) to perform live internet searches via DuckDuckGo, finding obscure facts to ground the narrative in reality.\n2.  **✍️ The Writer Agent (Creativity):** It takes the user's draft, the researched facts, and style preferences from long-term **Memory** to synthesize unique plot points.\n3.  **⚖️ The Critic Agent (Evaluation):** Implementing **AI Self-Evaluation**, this agent autonomously grades the output for quality and surprise before presenting it to the user.\n\n## ✅ Course Concepts Implemented\n\nThis notebook demonstrates a complete \"Prompt-to-Deployment\" workflow, incorporating key pillars of the Agent Development Kit framework:\n\n* **Tools & Function Calling (Day 1 & 2):** Agents are equipped with Python functions for web search and text analysis.\n* **Sessions & Memory (Day 3):** User preferences are stored in a persistent `MemoryBank`.\n* **Observability & Tracing (Day 4a):** A custom `AgentTracer` logs every step of the agent's \"thought process\" for transparency (visible in the deployed UI).\n* **Agent Evaluation (Day 4b):** An automated critic ensures quality control.\n* **Agent-to-Agent Communication (Day 5a):** Explicit data hand-offs between specialized roles (Research -> Write -> Critc).\n* **Deployment (Day 5b):** The final system is wrapped in an interactive **Gradio** web interface for easy testing.\n\n---\n### 🚀 How to Use This Notebook\n1.  **Run All Cells** sequentially to install dependencies and initialize the agents.\n2.  Scroll to the bottom cell to see the **Gradio Interface**.\n3.  Paste a paragraph of a story draft into the input box.\n4.

By equipping specialized agents with tools, memory, and the ability to evaluate their own work, \"The Muse\" provides a vastly more useful and grounded experience for writers than a standard chatbot.\n\n### 🚀 Future Directions\nWhile this prototype is functional, several interesting paths for future development exist:\n* **Persistent Database:** Replacing the in-memory `MemoryBank` with a real vector database (like Chroma or Pinecone) to store entire stories and character bibles.\n* **More Complex Tools:** Giving the Researcher Agent access to specific historical archives or scientific databases beyond general web search.\n* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Allowing the user to provide feedback on the critic's scores, fine-tuning the evaluation model over time.\n* **Expanded A2A Protocols:** Implementing a debate mechanism where the Writer and Critic agents can iterate on a twist before presenting it to the user.\n\nThank you for exploring \"The Muse.\" I hope it inspires you to build your own agentic systems!","metadata":{}}]}
